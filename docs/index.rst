.. OMNeT++/CMake documentation

Welcome to OMNeT++/CMake!
=========================

The OMNeT++/CMake module is a community effort to enable building, running and testing OMNeT++ projects with CMake.
Beside the classic OMNeT++ IDE, an OMNeT++ project relying on CMake can be imported by many editors if they just support CMake.

*This documentation is still work-in-progress!*
